## Automating the Cloudogu Ecosystem setup process
The setup mechanism of the Cloudogu Ecosystem can be performed in different ways. One way is to provide all necessary data and set all options via the web interface. Another way is to create a file called **setup.json** which contains some or all configuration data needed. This file has to be placed into the ``/vagrant`` or ``/etc/ces`` folder and needs to be formatted in JSON. All data defined in it will be automatically inserted into the corresponding setup web interface fields. If the entire configuration of the setup is present, the setup can be done fully automatically by setting all _completed_-values to true (see below).

Example:
````
{
  "region": {
    "completed": true,
    "locale": "en_US.utf8",
    "timeZone": "Europe/Berlin"
  },
  "dogus":{
    "defaultDogu":"cockpit",
    "install":[
      "official/cas",
      "official/cockpit",
      "official/jenkins",
      "official/usermgt"
    ]
  },
  "admin": {
    "username": "admin",
    "mail": "admin@testdomain.com",
    "adminGroup": "Administrators",
  }
}
````

### Setup steps
The setup.json file consists of objects named after the corresponding setup step (e.g. 'region' or 'admin'). These objects contain properties describing the configuration of this setup step. If the _completed_ property is set to ``true``, all properties of the setup.json for this step are accepted and the step will not show up in the web interface.
